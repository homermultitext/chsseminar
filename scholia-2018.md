# Scholia to the *Iliad*, 2018

##Starting point

The scholia we see in MSS of the *Iliad* draw on diverse sources of material, some of it originating in work as early as that of the Alexandrian editors. The scholia have been transmitted to medieval scribes via complicated routes we don't fully understand.  Some MSS seem to replicate more or less mechanically (but perhaps never purely mechanically) material from a single archetype (e.g., the Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1).  Other MSS creatively draw on material from multiple sources to create a unique new document (Venetus A).  These notes outline what I think we can say in 2018 about the transmission of scholia in a few of the oldest MSS of the *Iliad*.

For the Venetus A, my conclusions/hyptheses rest largely on systematic work analyzing large parts of the Venetus A scholia by Nik Churik for the interlinear scholia, and by Melody Wauke and Charlie Schuhfrieder on the relation of main, intermarginal and interior scholia.  My own reading of Venetus A scholia may have biased me towards some interpretations, but I feel confident that when their ideas are applied to a complete edition of the Venetus A (and, if possible, when further methods might be developed to test these ideas more thoroughly), their main conclusions will, taken broadly, still stand.

For the Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1, my brief suggestions are purely impressionistic, based only on reading a handful of scholia.   They may be completely overturned when we begin to edit those MSS.


## Venetus A

The scholia of the Venetus A are organized in distinct zones on the page, intentionally distinguished when each sheet was prepared, prior to writing any text.  It would be dangerous to assume that all scholia of the Venetus A can be treated as part of a single set  of "*the* Venetus A schoia" when the scribe has so deliberately set these zones apart.

The **exterior scholia** are related to the editorial process, as Allen (I think, convincingly) argued more than a century ago.  They refer to multiforms in the text of the *Iliad* and can comment on multiforms noted as alternatives in the main text of the *Iliad*.  I see no need to assume that the material commented on in the exterior scholia is drawn from other scholia:  it might be easier to explain these notes as collation directly against (one or more) other *Iliad*s.

>I don't know how we could be certain about this, but perhaps with a complete Venetus A, we could start to compare the VA's multiforms against the main text of other MSS?  (I would hesitate to trust even the fullest critical apparatus for such a comparison.)


The **interlinear** scholia belong to a tradition of lexical commentary that repeatedly inspired Byzantine scholars to create complete parallel "commentaries" that  Nik calls "metaphrases."  They are not exactly translations, but they can intelligily be read continuously, so they can work as a kind of trot/translation.  There are at least two good reasons why thinking of them as "translations" can be misleading to us.  First (as we see most clearly in the VA) the continuous metaphrase can degrade into glossing on phrases and single words. This is not really how a translation in our modern sense functions:  the metaphrases instead are aligning vocabulary in two dialects (contemporary, highly classicizing Byzantine Greek and the Homeric text).  (This is actually quite similar to what we see in Greek-Latin bilingual texts of various kinds.)   Second, Nik and I were able to show that the glosses that are aligned with the Homeric text are closely related to what we find in the *Homeric Lexicon* of Apollonius the Sophist.   I *think* we can make a good argument that this overlap reflects a shared tradition of glossing/lexical commentary: or, in other words, that the correlations between the glosses of Apollonius and the glosses in the VA cannot be dismissed as notes that any Greek speaker annotating a Homeric text would produce.

>I may need help with a good statistician to take this argument further.

The **main**, **intermarginal** and **interior** scholia derive from sources completely unrelated to the interlinear glossing.  The most obvious difference among these zones is that the main scholia are on average far longer than those in the intermarginal or interior zones. The content of material in the three zones is not identical, but the relations of the content in these three sets of scholia are more nuanced than the obviously different interlinear scholia.  Charlie and Melody used topic modelling to tease out some important points supporting the idea that we should read these three zones, too, as distinct "documents," derived from distinct sources.

1.  The zones are not simply designed for distinct topics:  no topics are unique to a single zone.
2.  At the same time, topics are strongly correlated with zones, and the concentration of topics by zone is very different.
3.  Some topics are explicitly about discussion and critique of earlier scholars.  Two particularly important topics were (1) a "verbatim Aristarchan"  topic, that (on several independent grounds) could be interpreted as language transmitted essentially verbatim from the commentary of Aristarchus, and (2) an "Aristarchan critique" topic.  The "verbatim Aristarchus" topic appears almost exclusively in the main zone.

These observations suggest that the main scholia derive, at least in part, from a source known to us nowhere else that preserved extensive, verbatim content from Aristarchus' commentary.  The main scholia, intermarginal and interior scholia all incorporate material that derives from sources later than Aristarchus. If the simplest intepretation of the layout of the Venetus A is that these zones were planned for material from distinct sources, then the source(s) of the main scholia had already mixed the verbatim Aristarchan scholia with content of other kinds before the time of the Venetus A's composition.

>I'm beginning to think of a number of ways we could explore this further.  We will have more options to explore this as we get better control of the morphology of the texts.

Some scholia of the "later critique" topic are duplicated in main and intermarginal zones.  This would be consistent with the suggestion that the scribe of the VA found these comments in different sources, and replicated them in each zone.  (The suggestion that these duplications show that the intermarginal zones are used for "short-hand" or "summarizing" repetition in the of material the scribe picked out from the main scholia is not tenable since it does not account for  the vast majority of the intermarginal/interior content.)  The overlap in  main and intermarginal/interior content would then be a consequence of earlier mingling of Aristarchan and later material in the VA scribe's source for the main scholia.

The intermarginal and interior zones are the most similar to each other.  Charlie looked at this question from several perspectives, and I need to revisit his work.  There are clear cases proving that the scribe did *not* view these zones as equivalent.  The fact that they have a great deal of similarity in content then probably means that the Venetus A scribe had two sources at hand with very similar material.



## The Venetus B/Upsilon 1.1


This pair of manuscripts gives us the clearest example of material derived from a single archetype.  As we edit these two manuscripts thoroughly, it will therefore be interesting to see how much variety 

## The Omega 1.12


## The "Townley Homer" (Burney 86)

## Manuscripts with Porphyrian questions
