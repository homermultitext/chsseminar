Seminar participants will be reimbursed for travel costs, and will receive a modest fellowship to help cover other expenses.

## Housing,  meals, and office space at CHS

Participants will be housed in shared apartments on the CHS campus.  All apartments have kitchens, and will initially be furnished with some simple breakfast food. On Monday through Friday, breakfast and lunch will be provided in the dining room in the main building.  Participants are free to make their own arrangements for other meals.

Seminar sessions will be held in the morning and afternoon on weekdays.  Outside of seminar sessions, participants will work in teams editing assigned sections of the two early manuscripts of the *Iliad*.  Each team will be given an office in the CHS main building.  Participants will have keys for 24/7 access to the main building and offices.

There will be no formal sessions on Sunday, July 15.  Participants are welcome to explore Washington, D.C. on the weekend.  Our seminar will wrap up with a closing dinner on Friday, July 20.  Participants may stay at CHS over the weekend.  Everyone should be checked out of their room before 11:00 am on Monday, July 23.

## Booking travel


Participants should make their own travel arrangements, and bring all receipts with them to the seminar.   We expect that  checks for travel reimbursement and fellowship will be ready before the end of the seminar.

Participants should arrive at the CHS on July 9.  Find the main building at CHS, and someone will help you get checked in to your room.



## Travel to CHS

The Center is located at 3100 Whitehaven Street, NW, Washington, DC.  There are two, unconnected sections of Whitehaven Street in Washington, so when taking a cab it is best to clarify "Whitehaven Street off of Massachusetts Avenue."   The most convenient Metro stop to the Center is Dupont Circle, a little over a mile from the Center.

### By train

On the Atlantic coast, Amtrak has frequent trains to Union Station, Washington.  The red line goes directly to Dupont Circle.  The cost of a cab will vary depending on traffic and time of day, and might typically range from $12-$20.


### By plane


The easiest airport is Washington National (DCA).   By metro, take the blue line to Metro Center, and change there to the red line to Dupont Circle.  A cab from DCA directly to the Center should cost roughly $20.

From Baltimore-Washington airport (BWI), frequent trains (both Amtrak and MARC commuter trains) run to Union Station: <http://www.bwiairport.com/en/travel/ground-transportation/trans/marc>

Dulles airport (IAD) has international flights, but is actually located about 25 miles away in northern Virginia.  Information on ground transportation from Dulles: <http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/5933.htm>. Direct metro service is not expected before 2018, although a bus connection can now bring you from Dulles to a silver line connection on the metro.


### By car

Parking is available at the Center for participants coming by car.  If you're new to driving in Washington, don't count on your GPS knowing about lane changes and road closings during commuting hours.
