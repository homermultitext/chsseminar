## Preparation prior to coming to Washington

1. **github account**  We use the free services on <http://github.com> to host our collaborative work.  Participants should create a github account if they do not already have one, and email Neel Smith with their github user name prior to coming to Washington.
2. **software to install ahead of time**.  All of our work will be done in a *virtual machine*
that includes all the software you need for working on the Homer Multitext project, so the anything software you need to install are the two applications that create and run the virtual machine.  If you have not already done so, please install these two programs on your computer:

    - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
    - [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Optionally, these videos from the Getty Museum offer useful introductions to the structure and manufacture of manuscripts:

- [The structure of a medieval manuscript][v1]
- [Making manuscripts][v2]
