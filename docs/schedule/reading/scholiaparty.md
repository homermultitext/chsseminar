title: Scholia reading party
layout: page
---



Each group will bring one or two examples of scholia they have worked on.   You should choose scholia that you want feedback on:  either because you think they are particularly interesting, and may be worth investigating further in a short research project, or because  you think they are particularly difficult and you want to bring in more people to help reading them.

Please keep notes in your repository (either in your team's wiki, or in a simple text file that you commit to the repository), listing all the references (as URN values) that you would like pull up in discussing your scholion.
